# Life Cycle Cost Model for Zemdrain-Products (LCMZ)
LCMZ calculates life cycle cost of a concrete member based on a variety of parameters. This software and its complete user guide can be downloaded directly from website of the company [Max Frank GmbH Co KG](http://www.maxfrank.com/intl-en/service/software/zemdrain-form.php).

They sponsored this project, and I'm not allowed to publish the code on my GitHub.
